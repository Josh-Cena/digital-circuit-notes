## On other platforms of publication

I am simultaneously updating the series on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/joshcena/posts). Zhihu offers pretty comprehensive markdown support except for tables (until recently), so they are inserted as screenshots.

I used to do it in my WeChat subscription, but Math support was horrible there, so I quit. But you may still [follow me](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/profile_ext?action=home&__biz=MzAwMzI0ODk0NA==&scene=124#wechat_redirect) and learn interesting stuff in all areas. (Don't know if the link works; in case it doesn't, you may look up **Josh Cena的百科知识仓库**.)

I'm planning to set up a personal blog, and once it's up, the series will appear there as well.

Translation of the articles to English is also on the agenda.

## On digital circuit simulators

I included a few simulation files, which can be opened with [iCircuit](http://icircuitapp.com).

## On reuse

This repo contains a `Zhihu.sty` file that attempts to mimic Zhihu typesetting in LaTeX. You may reuse this `.sty` file for your own purpose. A lot of the schematics are worth looking into as well.
